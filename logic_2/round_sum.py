CodingBat: round_sum
https://codingbat.com/prob/p179960

For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "def round10(num):" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as round_sum().

def round10(num):
    if num % 10 >= 5:
        return num - (num % 10) + 10
    else:
        return num - (num % 10)

def round_sum(a,b,c):
    return round10(a) + round10(b) + round10(c)
